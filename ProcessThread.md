# Program

## Static Program
- A program that doesn't change while it's running

# Process

![1](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/6e0a9dee-bf9f-43d7-910e-756edaa8d051)

- An instance of a computer program that is being executed

## Process Memory

### Text/Code
- a read-only area where the compiled program code resides

### Data
- Initialized Data Section : Containing global and static variables
- Uninitialized Data Section (BSS) : This includes global and static variables that are not initialized by the programmer. Initially, the operating system initializes them to zero.

### Heap
- Begining at the end of the BSS section and grows dynamically at runtime as more memory is needed for dynamically allocated variables 

### Stack
- for storing the function call stack, which includes local variables, return addresses, and other function-related information

## Process resource sharing

## Context Switch

### Problem of Context Switching on CPU Cache
- Cache Pollution : the previous process are replaced by entries needed by the newly scheduled process
- Clear or flush certain CPU Cache entries when switching between processe

### Solutions
- Tagged Caches : Some systems use tagged caches where cache lines are tagged with the process identifier (PID
- Selective Flushing : Sensitive contexts
- Cache Partitioning : Where parts of the cache are dedicated to specific processes or cores

- A component of a process, meaning that multiple threads can exist within the same process, sharing resources such as memory and file handles
- Each thread maintains its own independent sequence of execution.

## Thread Memory

- Allows a single physical processor core to behave like two logical processors to the operating system and the applications running on it

# CPU Processing Method

## Parallelism

- the practice of executing multiple operations or tasks simultaneously to speed up processing and increase efficiency

## Concurrency

## TCB (Thread Control Block)

# MultiThreading

# Application

## CPU Bound Application

- A CPU-bound application is one where the speed of the CPU is the primary factor determining the overall speed of the program
- Optimal Thread Cound = Core Count + 1

## I/O Bound Application

![3](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/6ea8ce12-c8e4-4e40-9d0e-e204a2da90e7)

- Threads can be over twice or three times more than Core Count
