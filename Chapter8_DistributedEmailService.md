# Chapter 8. Distributed Email Service

# Step 1. Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope

# Basic of the envelope estimation

## Assume QPS for sending emails
- 1 billion users
- The average number of emails a person sends per day is 10

> 10^9 x 10 / (10^5) = 100,000

## Assume Metadata
- The average number of emails a person receives in a day is 40
- The average size of email metadata is 50KB

+) Metadata refers to everything related to an email, excluding attchment files

- Metadata is stored in a database. 
- Storage requirement for maintaining metadata in 1 year

> 1 billion users x 40 emails / day x 365 days x 50KB = 730 PB

```yaml
From: John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
To: Jane Smith <janesmith@example.com>
Subject: Example Email
Date: Tue, 6 May 2024 10:00:00 -0700
Message-ID: <1234567890@example.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Mailer: ExampleMailer v1.0
```

## Assume Storage for attchments in 1 year
- 20% of emails contian an attchment
- The average attachment size is 500KB

> 1 billion uesrs x 40 emails / day x 365 days x 20% x 500KB = 1,460 PB

<br/><hr/><br/>

# Step 2. Propose High-Level Design and Get Buy-In

# Email Protocols

![1](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/f933fb84-2cc2-43c9-b042-a60f21df002d)

# Sending Emails

## [SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)](https://www.afternerd.com/blog/smtp/)

- Layer 7

+) [What is SMTP Server? An In-Depth Guide to Email Delivery in 2023](https://www.ranktracker.com/blog/what-is-smtp-server-an-in-depth-guide-to-email-delivery-in-2023/)

- Standard protocol for sending emails from one mail server to another

<br/>

- SMTP servers are made up of 2 key components

![image](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/95259cd6-f430-4739-8d02-78e39a4979ca)

### Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) = mail server
- The trasfer of emails between servers, MTAs ensure that your messages reach their intended recipients
- Comonly using SMTP for transferring mails between mail servers

### Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs)
- MDAs play a complementary role to MTAs in the email delivery process
- Using POP and Imap to retrieve emails from a mail server and deliver them to a recipient's mailbox

<br/>

## SMTP authentication 
- security measure that helps prevent spoofing and spamming
- SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)
- Users who want to send emails through an SMTP server are required to provide authentication credentical such as a username and password

ex) XOAUTH/XOAUTH2
- It is a basic authentication mechnism in mail servers
- It is based on OAuth signatures to authenticate users

```cmd
S: 250-AUTH LOGIN PLAIN XOAUTH XOAUTH2
C: AUTH XOAUTH2 dXNlcj1zb21ldXNlckBleGFtcGxlLmNvbQFhdXRoPUJlY
XJlciB5YTI5LnZGOWRmdDRxbVNSbGNrQJoZG1semRHRXVZMjl0Q2cBAQ==
S: 235 Accepted
```

### +) ESP (Email Service Provider)

- A company or organization that offers email-related services, tools and infrastructure to businesses, organizations and individuals
- Offering platforms and tools for creating, sending and managing email campaigns

+) Different from mail server
- mail server is a computer server responsible for sending, receiving and storing email messages

<br/>

# Retrieving Emails

## POP (Post Office Protocol)

- Layer 7
- [RFC 1939](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt)
- Once emails are `downloaded to your computer or phone`, they are deleted from the email server, which means you can `only access emails on one computer or phone`

## IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol)

- Layer 7
- [RFC 3501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501)
- It only downloads a message when you click it and emails are not deleted from mail servers
- You can `access emails from multiple devices`

## HTTPS

- It is not technically a mail protocol, but i can be used to access your mailbox, particularly for web-based email

ex) Microsoft Outlook

<br/>

# Domain name service (DNS)

![2](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/fc58adc5-cb44-42f5-acf6-5b91b7264fff)

- It is used to look up the mail exchanger record (MX record) for receipient's domain

```cmd
î‚° nslookup # DNS lookup
> set q=MX
> gmail.com
Server:		210.220.163.82
Address:	210.220.163.82#53

Non-authoritative answer:
gmail.com	mail exchanger = 40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com	mail exchanger = 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com	mail exchanger = 20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
gmail.com	mail exchanger = 30 alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```

- `# 53 = port 53` is indeed the standard port for DNS traffic

## DNS IP

<img width="655" alt="3" src="https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/a0520773-ce75-499f-88df-6b3c9aca7ef8">

- DNS servers can be configured manually or obtained automatically from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server

## The priority numbers

- Preferences where the mail server with `a lower priority numbers is more preferred`
- A sending mail server will attempt to connect and send messages to this mail server first
- If the connection fails, the sending mail server will attempt to connect to the mail server with the next lowest priority

<br/>

# Attachment

- Attachments are encoded using Base 64 algorithm

![5](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/f23c8fe4-76f9-4661-8c07-3eacd0627d0e)

- A size limit for an email attachment is highly configurable and varies from individual to corporate accounts
- `Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME)` is a specification that allows the attachment to be sent over the internet ([ISO-8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1))

<br/>

## Side note: Tranditional mail servers architecture

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-40 002](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/19cd1d36-3c4f-497e-914f-99c680809aeb)


### Storage

- Each email was stored in a seperate file with a unique name
- Each user maintained a user directory to store configuration data and mailboxes

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-40 003](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/213b3834-410c-4d2e-bb5c-752ab91d71c9)

- As the email volume grew and the file structure became more complex, disk I/O became a bottleneck
- The local directories also don't satisfy our high avilability and reliabiltiy requirements

<br/>

# Distributed mail server architecture

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-40 004](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/1c10f05c-dd79-4328-b631-f38cc3e05045)

<br/>

## Webmail
- Users use web browsers to receive and send emails

<br/>

## Web servers
- Web servers are public-facing request/response services/API, used to manage features

<br/>

## Real-time servers
- It is responsible for pushing new email updates to clients in real-time
- These are stateful servers because they need to maintain persistent connections

### [Websocket](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/blob/master/Chapter2_NearbyFriends.md#websocket-servers)
- advantage : elegant solution / drawback : browser compatibility
- To relieve the drawback, establishing a Websocket connection whenever possible and to use long-polling as a fallback

<br/>

## Metadata database
- The database stores mail metadata including mail subject, body, from users etc

<br/>

## Attachment store

### Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- It is a scalable storage infrastructure that's suitable for storing large files

### NoSQL

![6](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/69c3a3d9-f8f1-42a5-9ca2-dfb2e2658a95)

- Column-family databases
- Cassandra supports blob data type and its maximum theoretical size for a blob is 2 GB, `The practical limit is less than 1MB`
- We can't use a row cache as attachments take `too much memory space`

<br/>

## Distributed cache
- Since the most recent emails are repeatedly loaded by a client, caching recent emails in memory significantly improves the load time
- using `Redis` because it offers rich features such as lists and it is easy to scale

<br/>

## Search store
- The search store is a distributed document store
- `Inverted index` that supports very fast full text searches

![7](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/6cb868cb-b181-4257-8f3b-4a03862ecfc3)

<br/><hr/><br/>

# Email sending flow

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-41 005](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/43aae2b3-e390-424a-b842-ca4511f3c56b)

## Basic email validation

- Each incoming email is checked against `pre-defined rules` such as email size limit
- Checking if the domain of the `recipient's email address is the same as the sender`

## Metadata

- Each message in the outgoing queue contains all the metadata required to create an email

## Asynchronous mail processing

- A distributed message queue is a critical component that allows asynchronous mail processing
- By decoupling SMTP outgoing workers from the web servers, we can scale SMTP outgoing workers independently

### Monitoring the size of the outgoing queue

- The recipent's mail server is unavailable : In this case, we need to retry sending the email at a later time
- Not enough consumers to send emails : We may need more consumers to reduce the processing time

<br/><hr/><br/>

# Email receiving Flow

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-41 006](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/0b5874e0-e2be-4a6d-8e3e-5fe93dcab23f)

## Email Acceptance policy

- It can be configured and applied at the SMTP-connection level

ex) Invalid emails are bounced to avoid unnecessary email processing

## Attachement

- If the attachement of an email is too large to put into the queue, we can put it into the `attachment store (S3)`

## Push Notification

### Online users
- The email is pushed to real-time servers
- Real-time servers are `WebSocket servers` that allow clients to receive new emails in real-time

### Offline users
- Emails are stored in the storage layer.
- When a user comes back online, the webmail client connects to web servers via `RESTful API`
- Web servers pull new emails from the storage layer and return them to the client

<br/><hr/><br/>

# Step 3. Design Deep Dive

# Metadata database

## Characteristics of email metadata

- Email headers : usually small and frequently accessed
- Email body sizes : can range from small to big but are infrequently accessed. `You normally only read an email once.`
- Mails owned by a user are only accessible by that users and all the mail operations are performed by the same user
- `Data recency impacts data usage` : 82% of read queries are for data younger than 16 days

# Choosing the right database

- The database system is usually custom-made to reduce input/output operations per second (IOPS) as this can easily become a major constraint in the system

## Relational databse

### PROS
- We can build indexes for email header and body
- Simple search queries are fast

### CONS
- Relational databases are typically optimized for small chunks of data entries and are not ideal for large one (ex. html)
- Search qureis over unstructured Binary Large Object (BLOB) data type are not efficient

+) BLOB
- the native binary foramt = not directly human-readable
- it is suitable for "large objects"

## Distributed object storage
- Store raw emails in cloud storage such as Amazon S3

### PROS
- A good option for backup storage

### CONS
- Hard to efficiently support features such as marking emails as read, searching emails based on keywords etc

## NoSQL databases
- Google Bigtable is used by Gmail

### PROS
- It's a viable solution

### CONS
- Bigtable is not opensourced an how email search is implemented remains a mystery

<br/>

# Data model

![10](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/0ca6f46a-801b-4bbf-acb1-84b10733fb7d)

- One user is stored in `a single shard`
- One potential limitation with this data model is that mesages are not shared among multiple users

![9](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/ff2d834f-ddcc-413a-ac3e-d7f301d0fd82)

## The partition key
- It is responsible for distributing data cross nodes
- We want to spread the data envely

ex) user_id

## The clustering key
- It is responsible for sorting data within a partition

ex) user_id, folder_id / email_id (TIMEUUID)

### +) [TIMEUUID](https://pythonhosted.org/time-uuid/)

- version 1 uuid
- `60-bit timestamp` : this is based on the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since October 15, 1582
- `14-bit clock sequence` : used to maintain uniqueness across changes in the system's network address
- `48-bit Node ID` : usually the MAC address of the machine generating the UUID = hardware-specific identifier

<br/>

- Privacy concerns : contaning the MAC address of the machine where it was generated
- Sorting : ordering according to the time component

> NoSQL database normally only supports queries on partition and cluster keys

## Procedure of querying data

1. Getting all folders for a user
2. Displaying all emails for a specific folder
3. CRD a special emails
4. Fetching all read or unread emails

+) denormalization emails seperated by read_emails table and unread_emils table
- it's a bit more complicated and harder to maintain but it improves the read performance of these queries at scale

## Bonus point: conversation threads

- Threads are a feautre supported by many email clients
- It groups email replies with their original message
- This allows uesrs to retrieve all emails associated with one conversation
- Traditionally : a thread is implemented using algorithms such as `JWZ threading algorithm`

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-41 007](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/13629d07-4ab9-49b8-bae1-628bdbd2ec76)

### +) JWZ threading algorithm

![11](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/3332c00a-e0ee-4cab-ba50-9ee71e9b344a)

1. Gather all messages
2. Create a hash table of `message IDs`
3. Link Messages
- user the `References` header to find the previous message in the thread and link them accordingly
4. Parent-Child Relationships

### +) Modern methods

- Machine Laerning
- Database-Driven Approaches : Leveraging databse relationships and query optimization
- client-Side Threading
- Hybrid Approaches

<br/>

# Email deliverability

- The hard part its to get emails actually delivered to a user's inbox
- If an email ends up in the spam folder, it means there is a very high chance a recipient won't read it
- Email spam is a huge issue

## Dedicated IPs

- Dedicated IP addresses for sending emails
- Email providers are less liekly to accept emails from `new IP addresses that have no history`

## Classify emails

- Send different categories of emails from different IP addresses

ex) Avoiding sending marketing and important emails from the same servers because it might make ISPs mark all emails as promotional

## Warm-up email sending slowly

- Warm-up new IP addresses to build a reputation with providers

ex) According to Amazon Simple Email Service, it takes about 2 to 6 weeks to warm up a new IP address

- ISPs closly monitor the sending behavior from the new IP address

### +) Internet Service Provider (ISPs)

- Managing the flow of email traffic across the internet
- They act as gatekeepers, responsible for filtering and delivering emails to their users' inboxes
- `ISPs typically operate their own mail server infrastructure consists of servers`

### +) ISP Validation

- ISP validation checks typically occur when an email is received by the ISP's email servers

1. Sender Reputation : Assessing the reputation of the sender's ISP and IP address to determine if they have a history of sending spam or engaging in abusive behavior
2. Authentication : Verifying that the sender's email server is authenticated
3. Content Filtering : Analyzing the content of the email for spam-like characteristics etc
4. Delivery Policies : Enforcing delivery policies and filtering rules set by the recipient's ISP

## Ban spammers quickly

- Spammers should be banned quickly before they have a significant impact on the server's reputation

## Retries

- If the system fails to process an event, it retries
- If the maximum retry threshold is reached, the event is stored in a queue

## Feedback processing

- It is very important to set up feedback loops with ISPs so we can keep the complaint rate low and ban spam account quickly

1. `Hard bounce` : Email is rejected by an ISP because the recipient's email address is invalid
2. `Soft bounce` : It indicates an email failed to deliver due to temporary conditions, such as ISPs being too busy
3. `Complaint` : A recipient clicks the "report spam" button

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-41 008](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/54a812f1-18de-4c55-8511-848e67acaa92)

# Email authentication

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-41 009](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/51de3949-f358-4e2b-9e18-8e54d4c76abc)

- Some of the common techniques to combat phishing are 

## Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

![12](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/7db66336-5cb6-47f8-bd78-face5136add6)

- Verifying whether the mail server sending an email is authorized to send emails on behalf of a specific domain
- When an email is received the recipient's email server can check the SPF record of the sender's domain to verify if the email came from an authorized server

```cmd
v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 include:spf.example.com -all
```

- ipv4 : allowing emails to be sent from the IPv4 address range
- include : also check the domain
- all : accept emails that don't match any of the authorized sources but to treat them with suspicion

## DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

![13](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/91e128c2-3e10-4a5e-a2b1-ea8d901c6451)

```cmd
selector1._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "DKIM key for selector1"
selector2._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "DKIM key for selector2"
```

- Digitally signing email messages to verify their authenticity and integrity
- The domain owner generates a public-private key pair and publishes the public key in a DNS TXT recrod
- public key > DMS TXT record / private key > mail server
- When sending an email, the sender's mail server signs the email using the private key and adds a DKIM signature header to the message
- Upon receiving the emails, the recipient's mail server retrieves the DKIM signature from the mssage header and uses the public key published in the DNS record to verify the signature

## Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)

![14](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/9fa08f87-69c3-4733-9e05-779b832cd7c4)

- It builds upon SPF and DKIM to provide additional controls and reporting capabilities for email authnetication
- Domain owners can specify policies for how their emails should be handled if they fail SPF or DKIM checks
- DMARC also allows domain owners to specify where to send aggregate and forensic reports detailing email authentication results 

<br/>

# Search

- Searching for emails that contains any of the entered keywords in the subject or body
- The search features in email systems has a lot more writes than reads

## Option 1 : EalsticSearch

![8](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/d457a44a-8dce-47a3-913f-785c84ebd16b)

- We can group underlying documents to the same nodes using user_id as the partition key

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-41 010](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/b2205d98-08ca-462c-a360-69f1c5ad86a1)

- A search request is synchronous
- Reindexing is needed and it can be done with offline jobs
- Kafka is used in the design to decouple services that trigger reindexing from services that actually perform reindexing
- One challenge of adding Elasticsearch is to keep out primary email store in synch with it

## Option 2: Custom Search Solution

- The main bottleneck of the index server is usually disk I/O
- Since the process of building the index is write-heavy, a good strategy might be to use Log-Structure Merge-Tree (LSM)

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-54-56](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/41038ab5-45c7-43ad-91c8-209f7fc6a0ca)

- The write path is optimized by only performing sequential writes
- LSM trees are the core data structure behind databases such as BigTable, Cassamdra and RocksDB
- When a new email arrives, it is first added to level 0 in memory cache, and when data size in memory reaches the predefined threshold, data is merged to the next level
- LSM is to seperate data that change frequently from those that don;t

ex) Folder metadata : change more often due to different filter rules
Email data : don't change

> A general rule of thumb is that for a smaller scale email system, Elastic search is a good option

<br/>

# Scalability and availability
- Replicated across multiple data centers
- User communicate with a mail server that is physically closer to them in the network topology

![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-05-06-12-52-46](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/24548713-9146-4409-86d5-55fd0a39116b)

<br/>

# The Limitations of Traditional Storage

- As data grows, B-trees encounter challenges that impact voth performance and efficiency
- When updates or inserts occur, B-tree need to rewrite entire blocks of data, leading to substantial write amplification

<br/><hr/><br/>

# [LSM (Log Structured Merge)](https://medium.com/@mndpsngh21/understanding-the-log-structured-merge-lsm-tree-a-deep-dive-into-efficient-data-storage-d7ef3a7562ba)

- LSM Tree uses an append-only approach
- Incoming data is first written to an in-memory structure known as the `MemTable`
- This enables `lightning-fast write operations`, as data is placed in memory without the need for disk access

## Structure of LSM Tree

![1](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/1afd3aac-4130-4e2d-ac8e-897758adbc05)

### MemTable
- As a temprary sorting area for data
- As it fills up it contents are flushed to disk in a batch of sorted data structures called Sorted String Tables (SSTables)

### Sorted String Tables (SSTables) :star:
- They store data in sorted order, enabling efficient queries and range scans
- SSTables are ever modified, they are later merged into new SSTables or deleted as data is updated (= append-only file)

### Levels
- To manage data efficiently, SSTables are organized into levels
- Lower levels contain more recent data, while higher levels store compacted data
- This hierarchical approach balanced read and write performance, preventing bottlenecks

## Write Path and Compaction
- Multiple SSTables accumulate, compaction, a vital feature of the LSM Tree, merges these SSTables, removing duplicates and outdated entries

## Read Path and Bloom Filters
- `Bloom Filter` : A space efficient data structure that quickly dtermines whether a key might exist in an SSTable
- If Bloom Filter indicates a possible match, the LSM Tree fetches the SSTable containing the desired data

<br/><hr/><br/>

# [Bloom Filter](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/big-data/articles/what-is-a-bloom-filter/#:~:text=Bloom%20filter%20is%20a%20data,Insertion%2C%20Lookup%2C%20and%20Search%20Result)

- It is a data structure used to check whether an element is most definitely not in a dataset by using one or more hashing functions and an array of bits

![2](https://github.com/JaeYeonLee0621/a-mixed-knowledge/assets/32635539/5bf48d2a-8996-4a5a-a9cd-52989072b644)

- Inserting the hash value into an array of a fixed size and "remembers" that the hash value is entered

## Procedure

1. Accept the input
2. Calculate the hash value
ex) Jhon Doe > 1355
3. Mod the hash by the array length
ex) 1355 % 19 = 6
4. Insert the hash
ex) the sixth position in the array goes from 0 to 1
5. Search for the value (i.e. lookup)

## False positives
- Yeidling an outcome wherein the value of the key is not present in the array
- Looking for an element that does not exist can return an incorrect result
- When a hashing algorithm generates an identical hash value for two different data elements.
- Multiple hash functions can be used to minimize the collision rate. 
- Instead of setting a single bit for a single input, several bits are set. 
- However, this can slow down the algorithm.

<br/><hr/><br/>

# Organizing the terminology

## Sending Emails
- Use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- SMTP authentication : exchange emails between mail servers

+) ESP (Email Service Provider) : offering platforms and tools

## Verifying IPs (ISP)
- Dedicated IPs
- Classift emails
- Warm-up email sending slowly

## Verfying Emails (DNS)
- SPF (Sender Policy Framework) : SPF record (define IPs, domain name)
- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) : TXT record (public key)
- DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) : additional Domain level verification

## Receiving Emails
- POP (Post Office Protocol) : download emails, retrieve only at once 
- IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol) : retrieve evertime, everywhere
- Web Socket : real-time notifiying emails

## Database
- Sharding, Partitioning, Clustering
